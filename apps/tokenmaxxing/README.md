# Tokenmaxxing — every AI coding subscription, one glance

Claude, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Grok, Kimi, Z.ai… all your AI usage in your task
bar. No dashboards, no tab-digging, no mental math.

> **The Windows + Linux build of [OpenUsage](https://github.com/robinebers/openusage).**
> OpenUsage is a macOS menu-bar app by [Robin Ebers](https://github.com/robinebers) — and it only runs on macOS.
> Tokenmaxxing is the community port that brings it to **Windows and Linux**. Not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenUsage; all original design and credit go to its authors — see [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md).

## Platform status

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Windows** | ✅ NSIS installer, auto-updates. Beta — feedback welcome. |
| **Linux** | ✅ deb / rpm / AppImage, auto-updates. |
| **macOS** | Use **[OpenUsage](https://github.com/robinebers/openusage)** — it's native there and this fork doesn't ship a macOS build. |

The panel is a borderless, always-on-top window driven by a global shortcut. (On macOS, OpenUsage uses a native `NSPanel`; that code is kept but unshipped — port notes in [PORTING.md](PORTING.md).)

## Download

**[⬇ Latest release](https://github.com/falkoro/tokenmaxxing/releases/latest)** — pick your platform:

- **Windows**: `Tokenmaxxing_<version>_x64-setup.exe` (SmartScreen warns — unsigned; *More info → Run anyway*)
- **Debian/Ubuntu**: `Tokenmaxxing_<version>_amd64.deb`
- **Fedora/openSUSE**: `Tokenmaxxing-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm`
- **Any Linux**: `Tokenmaxxing_<version>_amd64.AppImage` (`chmod +x`, then run)

It **auto-updates**: checks GitHub releases every 15 minutes and updates in place. Fresh per-commit builds are also published as [Build Desktop artifacts](../../actions/workflows/build-desktop.yml) (requires GitHub login).

## What it does

Tokenmaxxing lives in your task bar and shows how much of each AI subscription you've burned — progress bars, plan badges, and pace indicators that warn you *before* you run dry.

- **One glance.** Every AI tool, one panel.
- **Pace-aware.** Green/amber/red dots flag when you're on track to run out early.
- **Always fresh.** Refreshes on a schedule you pick.
- **Global shortcut.** Toggle the panel from anywhere.
- **Plugin-based.** New providers ship without app updates.
- **[Local HTTP API](docs/local-http-api.md).** Read your usage from `127.0.0.1:6736`.
- **v01 measurement contract.** Optional structured token/model/source metrics with [compatibility and benchmark guidance](docs/baic-v01-compatibility.md).
- **Budget-aware routing.** The tested [`rankModels`](src/lib/model-recommendation.ts) utility selects a capable model using observed success, quota headroom, capacity, latency, and budget.
- **Outcome benchmarking.** The tested [`summarizeBenchmark`](src/lib/benchmark-metrics.ts) utilities report acceptance, test-pass rate, median/p90 tokens and latency, rework, and cost per accepted task, grouped by provider, model, plan, and task class.
- **Reproducible task suite.** The v01 benchmark tasks and acceptance gates are defined in [`docs/benchmark-suite.v01.json`](docs/benchmark-suite.v01.json), with three required runs per candidate.
- **Benchmark evidence gate.** Validate collected JSON/JSONL results with `npm run benchmark:validate -- path/to/results.json`; under-sampled or malformed candidates are rejected before routing decisions.
- **Conservative model routing.** Feed candidates matching the [v01 candidate schema](docs/model-candidates.v01.schema.json) to `npm run model:recommend -- candidates.json routine 15`; the command applies tier, budget, confidence, and 10% headroom gates before ranking.
- **Adoption evidence.** Broad-usage claims require an explicit denominator; the privacy boundary and reporting gates are documented in [`docs/adoption-measurement.md`](docs/adoption-measurement.md).
- **Acceptance boundary.** The [v01 completion matrix](docs/v01-completion-matrix.md) separates implemented local evidence from live-provider and adoption proof still required.
- **Live benchmark runbook.** Use the [authenticated benchmark runbook](docs/live-benchmark-runbook.md) to collect comparable three-run samples without exposing provider credentials.
- **Coverage audit.** Run `npm run metrics:coverage` to distinguish explicit structured-metric providers from runtime-derived quota coverage and line-only providers.
- **Committed-action measurement.** See [BAIC cost and action measurement](BAIC%20docs/merit-cost-action-contract.md) for local/no-call interaction tracking and cost-source boundaries.
- **[Proxy support](docs/proxy.md).** Route provider requests through SOCKS5 / HTTP.
- **[Remote dashboard](remote/README.md).** Serve your usage to other machines.
